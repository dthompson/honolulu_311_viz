# Honolulu 311

This is a quickly put together experiment using [d3.js](http://d3js.org) and [crossfilter](http://square.github.com/crossfilter/) using the data from [CitySourced](http://www.citysourced.com/neighborhood/5683/us/hawaii/honolulu-county)




TODO
* list report types (color code barchart, and map pins?)
* paging on listed reports
* show images when available
* pull data from citycourced api, not just csv file dump of reports
* geofilter?
